            Helia is designed to work with Chromium-based browsers such as Chrome, Opera, and modern Edge. You may experience issues using
            non Chromium-based browsers. Scheduled restarts occur at midnight EDT, 8am EDT, and 4pm EDT. The server takes ~30 minutes to 
            restart - if you can't log in now, try again later. As the project matures, these restarts will become less frequent.
