            The following document outlines the terms which you agree to by playing Helia. Your continued use of this software
            implies your agreement to these terms. If you do not agree to these terms, please cease using Helia immediately.

        <h3>Personal Conduct</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The author reserves the right to arbitrarily moderate or ban you at any time for any reason. Although there is no
                desire to do so, such actions may unfortunately be necessary to protect the project and the community in the event
                of especially egregious behaviour. The definition of "egregious" is solely at the discretion of the author.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                You agree not to post or otherwise transmit pornographic content, incitations to real world violence, the personal
                information of others, copyrighted content that you do not have rights to, or threats of real world violence within
                the Helia community.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                You agree to abide by the Federal Laws of the United States of America. Violation of US Federal Law within the Helia
                community will not be tolerated, and may result in an immediate ban. For especially egregious violations, the author
                may contact the appropriate law enforcement agency and provide evidence of the crime commited. Be aware that any 
                offenses that relate to child pornography are guaranteed to be reported to law enforcement, and conviction of such 
                offenses carries very severe criminal penalties.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                You agree not to take any intentional action that results in a disruption of, unauthorized access to, or damage to,
                the Helia servers. You are especially reminded to abide by the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, as it carries significant
                criminal penalties.
